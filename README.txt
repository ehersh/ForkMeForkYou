Emma Hershey -- README.txt

The following edits were made to this repo:

1. Started with just a README.txt that said "You will be using this repository soon..."

2. Changed README.txt to read "The six o' clock alarm would never ring..."
   This was called the "phrase that pays."

3. Changed README back to original message.

4. Added smiley.svg

5. Removed smiley.svg, added a folder called assets with a gif and mp3 called omfgdogs.  Very reminiscent of nyan cat but more colorful and less poptarts.

6. Changed README to just say "OMFGDOGS!"

6. Deleted everything.  No more omfgdogs :(
